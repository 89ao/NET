Phoenix is a framework for building compilers and a wide range of tools for program analysis, optimization, and testing. Phoenix is designed to support advanced techniques in compilation and program analysis. It provides a wide variety of building blocks, implemented around a common intermediate representation. Phoenix applies equally well to basic block analysis; memory tracing; code coverage; fault injection; run-time profiling and feedback; ahead-of-time and just-in-time compilers; and whole-program, post-link, and runtime optimization.

In its role as a compiler backend, Phoenix code generation can target a wide range of processor architectures.

Phoenix brings together the skills and expertise of three Microsoft groups: Visual C++, Microsoft Research, and .NET Common Language Runtime. It is intended as the basis of industrial-strength compilers and tools.

Phoenix is the code name for a software optimization and analysis framework that is the basis for all future Microsoft compiler technologies. The Phoenix framework is an extensible system that can be adapted to read and write binaries and MSIL assemblies and represent the input files in an IR, which can be analyzed and manipulated by applications by using the Phoenix API. The code can then be written in binary or JITable form for execution.

> **Practical Phoenix - A Hands-On Phoenix Tutorial at [CGO 2007](http://www.cgo.org/)**  
Thanks to all who joined us for the Practical Phoenix tutorial at the 2007 Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2007). The event was a great success! Practical Phoenix is a new hands-on tutorial that provides participants with source code and detailed notes for exploring loop structures in programs. If you did not get a chance to join us for the tutorial, or wish to continue working on it on your own, we're making the material available for [download](https://connect.microsoft.com/Phoenix/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?DownloadID=5742) (a free Windows Live ID is required).
